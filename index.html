		I describe our creative landscape like it’s a vast desert. There’s a lot of room to share creative works, but if you do not have collaborations to help point you through the dunes you can get easily lost.

		I write a lot to exercise my creative mind so I can prepare myself in my search for collaborators. When I run out of ideas, I take a nature walk. Nature is very <i>inspiring.</i>

		As I explore, I tend to leave a paper trail behind me. Drawing lines that crossover so much that it’ll eventually end up looking as <strong>chaotic</strong> as a spiderweb.

		<blockquote>The more collaborators I invite to my works, the more chaos will ensue. Though, with more chaos comes more insight within moderation. I decided to blockquote this using HTML, because I can and it fits with the chaos! I'm also adding these sentences as filler so we can see a contrast between what is normal and what is not!</blockquote>

		I like to throw my hat into the ring and provide my feedback on other people’s work too. Involvement often rewards credit. Each credit I receive becomes another piece to my own portfolio puzzle.
	</p>
	<ol> Some "puzzle pieces" include:
<li>Published writing</li>
<li>Twitch streaming</li>
<li>Press releases</li>
<li>And more</li>
</ol>
